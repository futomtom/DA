# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator-Project
### Abstract
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python#data-analysis-with-python-course) certification, to invest in my data analytics skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the [first project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator) in this curriculum. For this, I had to define a Python function (`calculate`) , whose argument was a 1x9 Numpy array. This function was to reshape this array into a 3x3 matrix, and return a dictionary whose elements contained 1x3 Numpy arrays across six summary statistics for said data. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). For this, I first cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment. I then devised a solution for this in the project [mean_var_std.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator-Project/blob/main/mean_var_std.py) file and annotated it with my problem-solving thought processes. I pushed my solution to this repository once all unit tests ([test_module.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator-Project/blob/main/test_module.py) and [main.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator-Project/blob/main/main.py)) had successfully passed and submitted its URL, to mark the project completion. This aided in developing my statistical and data analytics skills with Python, for the first project in this course.
